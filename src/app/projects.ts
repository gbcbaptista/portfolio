      "I developed a full-stack AI image classification application, from concept to cloud deployment. My responsibilities included training a Deep Learning model with TensorFlow/Keras, building a RESTful API with FastAPI, and containerizing services with Docker. I architected and automated the CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions, deploying the solution onto a cost-effective AWS Lightsail instance managed with Nginx and Docker Compose.",
