      "I developed a full-stack AI image classification application, from concept to serverless cloud deployment. My responsibilities included training a Deep Learning model with TensorFlow/Keras, building a RESTful API with FastAPI, and containerizing services with Docker. I architected and automated the CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions, deploying the solution onto AWS App Runner for cost-optimized serverless hosting with automatic scaling and pay-per-use pricing.",

In the Titanic challenge, I implemented Logistic Regression using only NumPy, engineered complex features, and troubleshot numerical stability issues by implementing a feature scaler, ultimately matching Scikit-learn's benchmark performance.",
