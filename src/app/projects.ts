    description:
      "I developed a full-stack AI image classification application, from concept to serverless cloud deployment. My responsibilities included training a Deep Learning model with TensorFlow/Keras, building a RESTful API with FastAPI, and containerizing services with Docker. I architected and automated the CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions, deploying the solution onto AWS App Runner for cost-optimized serverless hosting with automatic scaling and pay-per-use pricing.",

      "A deep dive into ML fundamentals where I build, debug, and refine algorithms from scratch. In the Titanic challenge, I implemented Logistic Regression using only NumPy, engineered complex features, and troubleshot numerical stability issues by implementing a feature scaler, ultimately matching Scikit-learn's benchmark performance.",

    description:
      "Developed a complete, end-to-end IoT solution, from hardware to a globally deployed web application. This project captures real-time temperature data from an ESP32 microcontroller, securely ingests it via MQTT into a fully serverless AWS backend, and visualizes the data on a dynamic Next.js dashboard. The architecture is event-driven, featuring real-time updates via WebSockets and automated frontend deployments through a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions.",
